# competitive-programming

Solutions for some competitive programming problems.
If you don't know what competitive programming is, there is
probably nothing useful to you here.

**Note:** if you come from "Taller de Programaci√≥n",
you can see the problem solutions if you want to learn,
but remember that you can't copy them for your assignments.
You can copy only known classic algorithms like Dijkstra.

**Note:** if you are a recruiter, this is not everything
I have coded in competitive programming.
I started publishing my solutions too late.
